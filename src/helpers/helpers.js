    description: `Brown sugar is a sweetener made from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). It's similar to white sugar, but contains varying amounts of molasses. Brown sugar can be refined or unrefined, but most brown sugar that you find in the baking section of the grocery store is refined. There are also other (less common) types of brown sugar, including turbinado sugar, muscovado sugar, and free-flowing brown sugar.
Health Benefits and Concerns
Brown sugar, like all sugar, is a simple carbohydrate that provides quick energy (glucose) to the body and the brain. Glucose is the brain's preferred energy source. However, excess calories and carbohydrates from sugar and other sources are stored as fat. So it is important to consume sugar in moderation.
Allergies
According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI), reports of true sugar allergy are rare, when sugars are defined as simple sugars. However, in response to an inquiry, the organization did report one case of fructose-induced anaphylaxis when a patient consumed Coca-Cola.The most common intolerance is acquired lactase deficiency, but sucrose may also cause problems in some people.`,

    description: `Granulated sugar is white table sugar (15 calories per teaspoon). It is the most recognizable form of sugar, usually found in sugar bowls and in packets on restaurant tables. Granulated sugar is refined, as opposed to some types of brown sugar which are often unrefined or partially refined. Sugar granules may range in size from very fine to coarse.Sugar may be included in a healthy eating pattern when consumed in moderation. But excess sugar consumption is common and can lead to health problems.
Health Benefits
Sugar is a simple carbohydrate and provides a quick source of energy (glucose) to the body. Your body's cells, tissues, and organs usually rely on glucose to function.
Excess carbohydrates from sugar and other sources are stored in the body for later use when energy (in the form of food) is not available. While your body can use other macronutrients such as fat and protein for fuel, carbohydrates are the preferred source as they are easily turned into glucose.
Sugar is also helpful in food processing. Sugar is widely used as a flavor enhancer, but it can also be used to create better food texture, add bulk, improve the shelf-life of packaged foods, and make products moist. Sugar is also used for fermentation.
Allergies
According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, there is no true allergy to sugar.But the issue is controversial as some believe that sugar consumption can cause hyperactivity. The organization states, however, that medical evidence of sugar-related hyperactivity is lacking.`,

Once steeped, the resulting green tea beverage is almost entirely water.
Potential Health Benefits of Green Tea
Many health benefit claims have been made about green tea for centuries. Traditionally, in China and India, green tea was a medicine for controlling bleeding, aiding digestion, and regulating body temperature. In modern times, research has been able to demonstrate some of its health benefits more solidly than others.

    description: `While goat milk may seem like a new trend in the United States, it's actually popular internationally and has been around for ages: over 65% of the world's population drinks goat milk. Packed with vitamins and minerals, this alternative to cow's milk is gentler on the stomach and provides a solution for some with lactose sensitivity. And believe it or not, goat milk is actually closer to human milk than cow's milk. Here's everything you need to know, including nutrition facts and more!
Goat milk vs. cow milk benefits:
It's easier to digest: According to experts at Meyenberg Goat Milk, goat milk is made up of very small fat particles which form a softer, smaller curd in the stomach. These small, soft curds are more quickly broken down by stomach enzymes, making it easier for the stomach to digest as compared to cow's milk.
It may work for those with lactose sensitivity: Although lactose is the main carbohydrate in dairy-based products, its content in goat milk is lower than other types of dairy. Experts at Meyenberg Goat Milk say that many people who react poorly to cow's milk don't have the same problems with goat milk.
It has higher levels of beneficial fatty acids: Compared to cow's milk, goat milk has substantially higher levels of short and medium-chain fatty acids.
Goat Milk Side-Effects & Allergies
Everything in the world has good as well as bad effects. There are some cons for goat milk also. It is not recommended to immediately give your children goat‚Äôs milk once they stop breastfeeding.
As they grow older, the nutrient composition of goat milk becomes appropriate, but for proper development, it is wise to begin with cow‚Äôs milk. Because it‚Äôs not as common, goat‚Äôs milk can be substantially more expensive than cow‚Äôs milk, causing a hole in your pocket.
Raw goat milk, which is the best for you, can be difficult to find outside of health food stores and farmers‚Äô markets. The taste and smell might not also be pleasing to everyone, particularly those raised with cow‚Äôs milk.`,

It also offers vitamin E and, when fortified, provides calcium.
Health Benefits
The micronutrients in almond milk provide several health benefits. Almond milk also provides a nutritious substitute for people who are lactose intolerant or sensitive to dairy and cannot consume cow's milk.6
May Boost Heart Health
Almond milk is an excellent source of vitamin E, providing more than 16 mg per one-cup serving. Vitamin E is believed to protect against oxidative stress, which may boost heart health and help protect your body against certain diseases including cancer, arthritis, and diabetes.
Improves Bone Health
A single serving of almond milk delivers 482mg of calcium, and research has shown that calcium helps you to maintain strong bones. It is also important for proper muscle contraction and nerve function.8
May Help Prevent Autoimmune Disease.With nearly 20% of your recommended daily value of vitamin D in one serving, almond milk may also be efficient in preventing autoimmune disease. Research has found that vitamin D can be powerful in fighting chronic diseases as well as autoimmune disorders.
May Support Skin Health
The vitamin E in almond milk may help keep skin healthy. This vitamin has been linked to improved skin health thanks to its ability to fight solar radiation by fighting free radicals.1
Allergies
If you have a tree nut allergy, you should not consume almond milk (or any other nut milk such as cashew milk, etc.).

In some cases, salt and food colorings are added. "Nut butters," on the other hand, are made by grinding nuts into a paste so that they have a consistency similar to butter made from cow's milk.
Health Benefits
Butter is popular among people who follow a low-carb diet or high-fat eating plan (such as a ketogenic diet). Like many forms of fat, butter is satisfying. Eating a small amount of satisfying fat may be better than consuming larger quantities of fat alternatives that are less satisfying and may include processed ingredients. In some cases, butter alternatives may increase your daily calorie and fat intake more than butter.
Despite its high fat content, regular butter contains about 400 different fatty acids and a number of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A and other nutrients.Fatty acids have important health benefits, such as improved heart health and reduced risk of heart disease.
Allergies
If you have a diagnosed dairy allergy or avoid dairy in your diet for any reason, you should avoid butter. Common symptoms of dairy allergy can include mild reactions such as hives or more severe symptoms including trouble breathing.

Baked goods and other products that contain butter may also cause a reaction. If you are unsure about your dairy allergy and are not sure if you can safely consume butter, check with your healthcare provider. `,

    description: `Yogurt is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures. Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor.If you're a healthy eater, you probably have yogurt in your refrigerator. The dairy food provides nutritional benefits especially for people who are looking to boost gastrointestinal health,1Ôªø trying to lose weight or improve their health.
Health Benefits
Helps You Feel Satiated
Foods that contain protein promote "satiety" or fullness.3 So if you eat yogurt for breakfast or lunch, you may not be as likely to get hunger cravings shortly after your meal.
Aids in Building Muscle
The protein in traditional or Greek yogurt can also help your body to build and maintain muscle. Recent studies have shown that Greek yogurt can help in boosting strength and muscle, as well as improving body composition when consumed post-exercise.4
Improves Bone Strength
Yogurt is also a good way to boost your calcium intake, especially if you are a non-milk drinker. Calcium helps to lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and famously, helps maintain strong bones.5 The National Institutes of Health recommends adults consume at least 1,000mg calcium per day.6
May Aid in Weight Loss
Lastly, consumers often buy yogurt in single serving cups, which makes eating the right portion size easy. For that reason, yogurt cups are popular with people who are trying to reach or maintain a healthy weight.Low-fat and non-fat yogurt is likely to have fewer calories, but there is also some evidence that full fat dairy can also be included in a successful weight loss program.
Boosts Gut Health
Thanks to its probiotic properties, yogurt has long been recognized as a gut-friendly food. Studies have confirmed that adding dairy yogurt to your diet can help reduce fat and support your gut microbiome, which is critical in a healthy gut and digestive system.Finally, remember that there are multiple strains of bacteria that can be added, so not each brand will have the same kind.
Allergies
If you are lactose intolerant, it's best to avoid yogurt. Depending on the variety ‚Äî as well as the milk ‚Äî you may experience a reaction to the yogurt, which can present bloating, indigestion, vomiting, or diarrhea symptoms.`,
